## Paper Reviews

Most work in this class consists of reading research papers. We will cover one paper per week. For each paper, you are required to write a review. Links to papers will be posted in the [[Syllabus]] at least one week before the review due date.

A review includes a short, neutral summary of the paper (1-2 paragraphs), followed by a list of strengths and a list of weaknesses of the presented technique or tool, in your opinion. For some papers, we will post specific questions you should answer in your review. Our goal is to get you to think deeply and critically about the paper, not to test you. You wonâ€™t be graded on the correctness of your reviews; any non-trivial review will get you 5%.

The reviews are due every **Wednesday** by the end of the day. The reviews must be submitted through the HotCRP conference management system (link coming soon).
