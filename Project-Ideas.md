Here are some project ideas, roughly in the order of increasing difficulty / scope. The list is likely to be extended. Please talk to us before deciding on your project topic.

* Apply ideas from Sketch-n-Sketch to create Excel-style plot generation tools, except the generated plots would be in TikZ/R/... and a wide range of their parameters would be configurable through direct manipulation
* Use CEGIS (?) to infer refinement types for recursive functions in LiquidHaskell
* Implement generic equivalence reduction based on specifications of components (e.g. refinement types) rather than a predefined set of equivalences
* "De-normalization": Use probabilistic models (PHOGs?) to made a program generated by a specification-based synthesizer more readable
* Synthesizing test generators for refinement types (instead of solving constraints at run time like in [type-targeted testing](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-46669-8_33), synthesize a program that efficiently emits a stream of valid inputs)
* Use program synthesis to implement generic Stream Fusion (not limited to a predefined library of functions on lists)
