Here are some project ideas, roughly in the order of increasing difficulty / scope. The list is likely to be extended. Please talk to us before deciding on your project topic.

* Use one the frameworks (Sketch/Rosette/PROSE) to implement a synthesizer for a new DSL
* (Synthesis + architecture) Use synthesis to enhance the URISC approach to fault tolerance. [This paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6679035) proposes to re-implement faulty instructions using a single Turing-complete instruction `subleq`. However, they had to come up with `subleq`-encodings for all instructions by hand; we could automate it using synthesis.
* Use synthesis to infer refinement types for recursive functions in LiquidHaskell without using qualifiers
* Synthesis of distributed programs: take [Bakst et al OOPLA'17](http://abakst.github.io/oopsla17.pdf) and reverse their sequentialization procedure to produce distributed programs from sequential ones; there can be various levels of difficulty, depending on whether the sequential program is already annotated with processes and has the work clearly split
* (Synthesis + databases) In the context of [coordination avoidance](www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p185-bailis.pdf), automatically synthesize functions that merge database replicas that have diverged
* Implement generic equivalence reduction based on specifications of components (e.g. refinement types) rather than a predefined set of equivalences
* "De-normalization": Use probabilistic models (PHOGs?) to made a program generated by a specification-based synthesizer more readable
* Synthesizing test generators for refinement types (instead of solving constraints at run time like in [type-targeted testing](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-662-46669-8_33), synthesize a program that efficiently emits a stream of valid inputs)
* Use program synthesis to implement generic Stream Fusion (not limited to a predefined library of functions on lists)
* Apply ideas from Sketch-n-Sketch to create Excel-style plot generation tools, except the generated plots would be in TikZ/R/... and a wide range of their parameters would be configurable through direct manipulation
